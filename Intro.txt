Internet works :-

. Internet transmit by the optical fibers which is planted under the sea ocean.
. Then the data transmit from the data center via optical fibers cables and the large organization owns this like Jio, Airtel etc.
. And then internet reaches at your location through ISP(Internet Service Provider) because you have IP address and device connected to the router etc.   


SERVER :-

. Web Server =  To serve the static content like HTML pages, images and videos
. Email Server = To serve the email info.
. File Server = To serve the file info.
. DB Server = To perform some CRUD operation.
. App Server = To facilitate applications (youtube.com, facebook.com) and server dynamic data.

Application Server = To serve dynamic data. Like Node.js Server, Golang Server
Web Server = To serve static data.  Like  Nginx, Apache Kafka 


Standalone Apps = It doesn't need anything like servers, databases, network connection etc.
Web Apps = It need servers, databases, network connection etc to operate the applications.


----------------------------- OS ----------------------------------
Linux was made by Linus Torvalds in 1991. 

90% people uses windows OS.
90% application runs on the Linux OS.


Unix and Linux

. Linux OS (flavour Ubuntu, centOS, Debian, Kali Linux)


How can we access remote location server.
1. RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
2. SSH (secure shell)
3. AnyDesk


--------------------- Kernal, BootLoader ------------------------------------ 

Linux :- 

. Linux is a Operating system and Kernal is the heart of linux. Kernal has mainly programs, logic codes and files in order to run the whole Operating system. Kernal name Linux Kernal
. Kernal is a core part of the Operating system. It is written in the C programming language mainly and how can we interact and communicate this kernal so in this case we have shell commands (Shell).
. Shell is a gateway or interface between user and kernal. So if someone has to master linux in this case they must master the shell commands in order to communicate with the kernal.


BootLoader :-

. BootLoader is a process in Kernal which runs the files of Operating system needed when switch ON the machine.
. GRUB is a bootloader and is the program on linux systems that loads and manages the boot process. (GRand Unified BootLoader)


--------------------- Linux Architecture ------------------------------------ 
Utilities, Applications, Terminal and other Desktop icons
                       |
                     Shell 
                       |
                     Kernal
                       |
                    Hardware


--------------------- States of the processes ------------------------------------ 
. Stop
. Running
. Sleeping
. Kill
. Zombie



--------------------- Terminal ------------------------
Terminal is the point where we can control the kernel through shell commands.
